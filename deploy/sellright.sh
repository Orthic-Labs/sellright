                      Rolls back to the previous images automatically if a
                      functional check fails before reopening.
                      --from-source builds api/admin/storefront locally from
                      SELLRIGHT_SOURCE (a checked-out repo, via
                      compose.build.yaml) instead of pulling+cosign-verifying
                      registry images — for owners running private forks with
                      no image registry. Same maintenance/backup/migrate/
                      functional-check/rollback flow either way.
